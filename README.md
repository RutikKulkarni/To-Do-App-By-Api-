# Project Overview

This project is a simple To-Do web application built with React. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, completing, and uncompleting them. The application fetches task data from an external JSON API, making it easy to work with dynamic task lists.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks by entering a task title in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.

- **Complete Tasks:** Tasks can be marked as completed by checking the checkbox next to each task in the "Tasks" list. Completed tasks are then moved to the "Completed Tasks" list.

- **Uncomplete Tasks:** Completed tasks can be uncompleted by checking the checkbox in the "Completed Tasks" list. This action moves the task back to the "Tasks" list.

- **View Completed Tasks:** Users can easily view their completed tasks in a separate "Completed Tasks" list.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The application is built using the React JavaScript library, making it a dynamic and interactive web app.

- **CSS:** CSS is used for styling the app, providing a clean and visually appealing user interface.

- **JSONPlaceholder API:** Task data is fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API (API Link: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), which serves as a placeholder for testing and prototyping.
